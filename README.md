# üë®‚Äçüíª Coding Interviews

Data structures, standard algorithms, and coding problems.

```bash
# From root of project
mkdir bin
cmake ..
make
```

## Mistakes

- Understanding the problem:
  - Not defining enough example inputs to work on.
  - Missing edge cases.
  - Not realizing certain constraints until I'm halfway through coding.
- Coming up with an algorithm:
  - Not finishing all aspects of the algorithm "on paper" before coding.

## Strategies to remember

- Note every detail given in the problem. They're all likely necessary for an optimal solution.
- "Your first algorithm doesn't need to use [all of] the information [given in the problem]. But if you find yourself stuck, or you're still working to develop something more optimal, ask yourself if you've used all the information." (CTCI)
- Test on base cases, a trivial case, a sufficiently large + valid case, edge cases, and invalid inputs.
- Write modular code (abstract logic with functions), then solve each subproblem. Reduces errors and makes code more readable.
- When writing in (relatively more) verbose languages, it's okay to assume the existence of helpers, create structs, or assume a feature that another language has.
